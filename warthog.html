                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The warthog (<em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>) is a wild member of the pig family found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It gets its name from the wart-like growths on its face, which are actually protective pads.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Warthogs use their tusks for digging and defense, and often kneel on their front knees while feeding on grass and roots.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They are fast runners and can often be seen trotting with their tails held straight up â€” a comical but charming sight in the wild.
