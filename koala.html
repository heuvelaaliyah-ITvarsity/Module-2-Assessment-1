                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia. 
                    It is famous for its fluffy ears, large nose, and sleepy demeanor.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Koalas feed exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are tough and low in nutrition. 
                    As a result, they sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy.

                <p>
                    Although often called "koala bears," they are not bears at all but marsupials â€” 
                    meaning they carry their young in a pouch.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Koalas live in eucalyptus forests and woodlands and play an important role in 
                    maintaining the health of these ecosystems.
