                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The gemsbok (<em>Oryx gazella</em>) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. 
                    It is easily recognized by its striking black and white facial markings and long, straight horns.

                <p>
                    Gemsbok are highly adapted to desert environments and can survive for long periods without drinking water. 
                    They obtain moisture from the plants they eat and are most active during the cooler parts of the day.

                <p>
                    Both males and females have horns, which can reach up to 85 cm in length. They use them for defense 
                    against predators such as lions and hyenas.

                    Their diet mainly consists of grasses, roots, and shrubs. The gemsbok’s elegant appearance and 
                    impressive endurance make it one of Africa’s most iconic desert animals.
