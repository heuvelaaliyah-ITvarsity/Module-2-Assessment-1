                    Monkeys are primates found in tropical forests, savannas, and mountains around the world. 
                    They are intelligent, social animals known for their agility and curiosity.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    There are two main groups: Old World monkeys from Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys 
                    from Central and South America.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Monkeys use their hands and tails to climb, swing, and gather food such as fruits, leaves, 
                    insects, and nuts.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Their playful behavior and expressive faces make them some of the most fascinating animals to observe.
