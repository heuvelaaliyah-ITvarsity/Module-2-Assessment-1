                <h3>LION</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the largest cats in the world and is known as the “King of the Jungle.” 
                    Lions live in groups called prides, which are led by females.

                <p>
                    They are native to Africa and parts of India, inhabiting savannahs and grasslands.

                    Male lions are distinguished by their thick manes, which vary in color from blond to black. 
                    Lions are powerful hunters and feed mainly on large herbivores such as zebras and wildebeest.

                    Lions are social animals and spend much of their time resting, grooming, and strengthening bonds within the pride.
