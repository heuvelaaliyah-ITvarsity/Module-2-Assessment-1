                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) is native to China and is known for 
                    its distinctive black and white fur and gentle nature.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up more than 99% of their diet. 
                    They can spend up to 14 hours a day eating!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas rarely eat meat. They live in 
                    mountain forests and play a crucial role in spreading seeds and maintaining bamboo forests.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Pandas are a symbol of peace and conservation worldwide and are considered a national treasure in China.
